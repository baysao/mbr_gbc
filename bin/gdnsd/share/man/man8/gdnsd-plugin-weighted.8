.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBgdnsd-plugin-weighted\fR can be used to return one (or a subset)
of several address records, or one of several \s-1CNAME\s0 records
based on dynamic-weighted probabilities.
.SH "CONFIGURATION \- TOP LEVEL"
.IX Header "CONFIGURATION - TOP LEVEL"
At the top level, there are three special parameter keys: \f(CW\*(C`service_types\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`up_thresh\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`multi\*(C'\fR.  \f(CW\*(C`multi\*(C'\fR is ignored for CNAME-based
resources.  All of these keys are inherited and
override-able at the per-resource and per-address-family levels.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`service_types\*(C'\fR sets how the applicable addresses or CNAMEs are
monitored.  The top-level default \f(CW\*(C`service_types\*(C'\fR is \f(CW\*(C`up\*(C'\fR, which is a
built-in service type provided by gdnsd.  For more information about
configuring non-default service type's, see the main \fBgdnsd.config\fR\|(5)
documentation.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`multi\*(C'\fR is a boolean that can be \f(CW\*(C`true\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`false\*(C'\fR, and defaults to
\&\f(CW\*(C`false\*(C'\fR.  \f(CW\*(C`multi\*(C'\fR controls the behavior of the algorithm
for selecting result addresses, discussed in detail later.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`up_thresh\*(C'\fR defines a floating point fraction of summed address weights
in the range \f(CW\*(C`(0.0 \- 1.0]\*(C'\fR, defaulting to \f(CW0.5\fR, and is used to
influence failure/failover behavior.
.PP
Other than those three, the rest of the top level keys are the names of
your resources, and their values are the configuration of each resource.
.SH "CONFIGURATION \- PER-RESOURCE"
.IX Header "CONFIGURATION - PER-RESOURCE"
Inside a given resource's configuration hash, again the three
address-related parameters \f(CW\*(C`services_types\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`multi\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`up_thresh\*(C'\fR
may be specified to override their settings per-resource.
.PP
There are two basic configuration modes within a resource:
.PP
1) Explicit per-family address sub-stanzas.  In this mode, the resource
contains one or more of the keys \f(CW\*(C`addrs_v4\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`addrs_v6\*(C'\fR.  Usually
one would use both together, as it's simpler to use the second option
when configuring a single address family.
.PP
The contents of each stanza configure response RRs of the given address
type for this resource, and the 3 behavioral parameters \f(CW\*(C`service_types\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`multi\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`up_thresh\*(C'\fR can be overridden per-address-family as well.
.PP
2) Automatic top-level detection of just one address family or CNAMEs.
In this mode, you can configure the top-level of a resource with direct
entries, so long as they are matching set of a single type: all IPv4
addresses, all IPv6 address, or all CNAMEs, and the type will be
auto-detected.
.PP
Resources which contain weighted lists of CNAMEs
rather than addresses can only be used with \f(CW\*(C`DYNC\*(C'\fR RRs in zonefiles, whereas
those that contain only addresses can be used in either \f(CW\*(C`DYNC\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`DYNA\*(C'\fR
RRs.
.SH "CONFIGURATION \- CNAMES"
.IX Header "CONFIGURATION - CNAMES"
When configuring cnames, the value of each item should be
\&\f(CW\*(C`[ CNAME, WEIGHT ]\*(C'\fR, and the resource will be useful for \f(CW\*(C`DYNC\*(C'\fR zonefile
records, resolving to a weighted \s-1CNAME\s0 record in responses.  The selection
algorithm based on weights and monitoring results is as documented below
for addresses in the \fB\s-1THE UNGROUPED SINGLE CASE\s0\fR, since groups of
CNAMEs cannot be configured, and the \f(CW\*(C`multi\*(C'\fR option is not valid for them.
.PP
\&\s-1CNAME\s0 data must be fully qualified (ends in \*(L".\*(R"), and a \f(CW\*(C`DYNC\*(C'\fR cannot be used
to emit a \s-1CNAME\s0 that points into the same zone that contained the \f(CW\*(C`DYNC\*(C'\fR.
.SH "CONFIGURATION \- ADDRESSES"
.IX Header "CONFIGURATION - ADDRESSES"
With the exception that \f(CW\*(C`addrs_v4\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`addrs_v6\*(C'\fR must contain only
addresses of the correct family (or in the top-level auto-detect case,
the top level entries must all be of the same family), the two stanzas
behave identically.  When both are present, they are both used in every
\&\f(CW\*(C`DYNA\*(C'\fR response (as gdnsd always includes opposite-family records in
the Additional section of A/AAAA queries).
.PP
Within either address family type, there are two different binary
dimensions (multi \-> true/false, and grouped-vs-ungrouped) upon which the
configuration and behavior hinge, leading to four different possible cases:
ungrouped-single, ungrouped-multi, grouped-single, and grouped-multi.  Each
will be discussed in detail below:
.SH "THE UNGROUPED SINGLE CASE"
.IX Header "THE UNGROUPED SINGLE CASE"
This is the simplest case.  The code detects this case when it sees that
\&\f(CW\*(C`multi\*(C'\fR is false (the default), and that the values of the keys are arrays
rather than sub-hashes.  Each hash key is an address label, and each value
is an array of \f(CW\*(C`[ IPADDR, WEIGHT ]\*(C'\fR.
.PP
When answering a query in this case, first the weights are converted to
dynamic weights.  The dynamic weight of an address is its configured weight
if the monitored state is \f(CW\*(C`UP\*(C'\fR, or zero if the monitored
state is \f(CW\*(C`DOWN\*(C'\fR.  The dynamic weights are summed to produce a dynamic
weight total, and then a single address to respond with is chosen from the
set, with each address having the odds \f(CW\*(C`addr_dynamic_weight /
total_dynamic_weight\*(C'\fR.
.PP
However, if the \f(CW\*(C`total_dynamic_weight\*(C'\fR is less than \f(CW\*(C`ceil(up_thresh *
total_configured_weight)\*(C'\fR, then the dynamic weights are all reset to their
configured full values so that the response odds are the same as if all
were \f(CW\*(C`UP\*(C'\fR, and resource-level failure is signalled to any upper-layer
meta-plugin (e.g. metafo or geoip) when applicable.
.PP
Example (X could be a whole resource, or an addrs_v4 stanza):
.PP
.Vb 7
\&  X => {
\&    multi => false # default
\&    # odds below assume no addresses are down:
\&    lb01 => [ 192.0.2.1, 45 ] # 25% chance (45/180)
\&    lb02 => [ 192.0.2.1, 60 ] # 33% chance (60/180)
\&    lb03 => [ 192.0.2.1, 75 ] # 42% chance (75/180)
\&  }
.Ve
.SH "THE UNGROUPED MULTI CASE"
.IX Header "THE UNGROUPED MULTI CASE"
This case is detected when, (as above) the values of the keys are arrays
of \f(CW\*(C`[ IPADDR, WEIGHT]\*(C'\fR, but the parameter \f(CW\*(C`multi\*(C'\fR is true.  The change
from the above behavior is primarily that multiple addresses from the
weighted set can be returned in each response.  The \f(CW\*(C`maximum\*(C'\fR, rather
than the sum, of the dynamic weights (again, zero for down addresses,
configured-weight otherwise), is found, and the odds of each address's
inclusion in the response set is
\&\f(CW\*(C`addr_dyanmic_weight / max_dynamic_weight\*(C'\fR.
.PP
This means all non\-\f(CW\*(C`DOWN\*(C'\fR addresses which share the group's maximum
dynamic weight value will always be included, whereas others will be
optionally included depending on the odds.  At least one address is always
returned (because logically, at least one address has the maximum weight,
giving it a 100% chance), and sometimes the full non\-\f(CW\*(C`DOWN\*(C'\fR set will be
returned.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`up_thresh\*(C'\fR behaves as in the previous case: If the sum of the dynamic
weight values is less than \f(CW\*(C`ceil(up_thresh * total_configured_weight)\*(C'\fR,
then the dynamic weights are all set to their configured values and the
result set is calculated as if all were \f(CW\*(C`UP\*(C'\fR, while signalling
resource-level failure to upstream meta-plugins (geoip or metafo).
.PP
Example:
.PP
.Vb 10
\&  X => {
\&    multi => true
\&    # odds below assume no addresses are down:
\&    lb01 => [ 192.0.2.1, 45 ] # 75% chance (45/60)
\&    lb02 => [ 192.0.2.1, 60 ] # 100% chance (60/60)
\&    lb03 => [ 192.0.2.1, 60 ] # 100% chance (60/60)
\&    # overall possible result\-sets:
\&    # lb01,lb02,lb03 \-> 75%
\&    # lb02,lb03 \-> 25%
\&  }
.Ve
.SH "THE GROUPED SINGLE CASE"
.IX Header "THE GROUPED SINGLE CASE"
The grouped cases are detected when the keys' values are sub-hashes at
the outer level rather than arrays of \f(CW\*(C`[ IPADDR, WEIGHT]\*(C'\fR.  In the grouped
case, first the set is divided into named groups, and then within each group
individual addresses are configured as
\&\f(CW\*(C`addrlabel => [ IPADDR, WEIGHT ]\*(C'\fR.
.PP
Example:
.PP
.Vb 12
\&   X => {
\&     group1 => {
\&       lb01 => [ 192.0.2.1, 10 ]
\&       lb02 => [ 192.0.2.1, 20 ]
\&       lb03 => [ 192.0.2.1, 30 ]
\&     }
\&     group2 => {
\&       lb01 => [ 192.0.2.7, 10 ]
\&       lb02 => [ 192.0.2.8, 20 ]
\&       lb03 => [ 192.0.2.9, 30 ]
\&     }
\&   }
.Ve
.PP
The grouped single case, of course, occurs when the configuration layout
is as shown above, and the \f(CW\*(C`multi\*(C'\fR parameter is \f(CW\*(C`false\*(C'\fR (the default).
.PP
In grouped-single mode, essentially the groups are weighted against each
other similarly to the single case for ungrouped addresses, resulting in
the choice of a single group from the set of groups. Then the
addresses within the chosen group are weighted against each other in
multi-style, returning potentially more than one address from the chosen
group.
.PP
Specifically, each group's odds of being the single group chosen is
\&\f(CW\*(C`group_dyn_weight / total_dyn_weight\*(C'\fR, where the group's dynamic weight
is the sum of the dynamic weights within it (\f(CW\*(C`DOWN\*(C'\fR addresses are zero),
and the total dynamic weight is the dynamic sum of all groups.  Then
within each group, the odds of each address being included in the
multi-response set is \f(CW\*(C`addr_dyn_weight / group_max_dyn_weight\*(C'\fR.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`up_thresh\*(C'\fR operates on all groups as a whole, and if the non\-\f(CW\*(C`DOWN\*(C'\fR
sum of all weights in all groups fails to meet the standard
of \f(CW\*(C`ceil(up_thresh * total_sum_configured_weight)\*(C'\fR, then all addresses
will be treated as if they are \f(CW\*(C`UP\*(C'\fR for selection purposes, and
resource-level failure will be signalled upstream.
.SH "THE GROUPED MULTI CASE"
.IX Header "THE GROUPED MULTI CASE"
You can probably infer this one's behavior from reading about the
previous three cases.  The difference from the previous grouped-single
case is that the multi-vs-single behaviors are reversed.  Multiple
groups are chosen based on the dynamic maximum weight between the
groups, and a single weighted address is returned from the subset
within each chosen group.  All of the details above logically apply
in the way you would expect, as all of these four cases internally share
the same code and logic, they just apply different bits of it to
different subsets of the problem.
.SH "GENERAL NOTES ON ADDRESS MODE CASES ABOVE"
.IX Header "GENERAL NOTES ON ADDRESS MODE CASES ABOVE"
Note that any time multi-selection is in effect at a layer
(the top layer when multi is true, or within a group when
when multi is false), the minimum count of chosen items will
be the count of items that share the maximum weight within the set.
e.g. a set of items with weights \f(CW\*(C`30, 30, 30, 20, 20\*(C'\fR will always
choose at least 3/5 items (because the first three have 100%
odds of inclusion), and the total response set will range
as high as all 5 items with some probability.
.PP
A practical use-case example for grouped-single:
.PP
Splitting groups on subnet boundaries in grouped-single mode
gives the result that a single response packet never mixes subnets.
This would enable your DNS-based balancing to defeat certain forms
of client-level Destination Address Selection interference, while
still returning multiple addresses per response (all from one
subnet).
.PP
A practical use-case for grouped-multi:
.PP
Suppose you have a large set of addresses which can be logically grouped
into subsets that have some shared failure risk (e.g. subpartitions of a
datacenter which share infrastructure).  With grouped-multi behavior,
clients will get up to N (count of groups) addresses in a round-robin
response, but a given response set will never contain two addresses from
the same group/subset.  This maximizes the chance that the client can
successfully fail over to another address in the list when its primary
selection fails, since the total set in each response does not share any
per-subset failure mode.
.SH "LIMITS"
.IX Header "LIMITS"
All weights must be positive integer values greater than zero and
less than 2^20 (1048576).
.PP
There is a limit of 64 addresses, address-groups, or cnames at the
top level of a resource (or per address family in the addrs_v4/addrs_v6
cases), and a limit of 64 addresses within each address group in
the grouped modes.
